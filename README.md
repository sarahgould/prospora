Will your spores thrive... or be driven to extinction? Their destiny is in your hands.

- Control your colony of spores with three genes: attack, spawn, travel.
- Launch spores to connect to new planets.
- Defend your homeworld from invaders.
- Expand your territory and adapt to enemies on multiple fronts.
- Half an hour of dramatic meditation.

Conquer a tiny universe.
